MFCCs are the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients. MFCC takes into account human perception for sensitivity at appropriate frequencies by converting the conventional frequency to Mel Scale.

Dynamic time warping (DTW) is one of the algorithms for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed. For instance, similarities in walking could be detected using DTW, even if one person was walking faster than the other, or if there were accelerations and decelerations during the course of an observation.
